# Stm32f4_Operation_On_Regs
Learning how to use Stm32 by directly accessing to registers instead of pre-built functions.

 For better understanding of registers of Stm32f4 I have decided to dive 
into operation in reg level. I have not completed my aim and I will start from simplest example by 
blinking on-board LEDs of Stm32f4 and then I will advance by accumulating my technical knowledge to
harder examples.

 Thanks to Tilen Majerle for his priceless libraries for beginners. I found inspiration from his examples.
